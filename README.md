## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Libraries
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn shap imbalanced-learn
```

Or using conda:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
conda install -c conda-forge shap imbalanced-learn
```

## Tutorial Overview

### 1. Data Preparation (`1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`)
Learn the essential steps of preparing data for machine learning:
- Loading and exploring datasets
- Data splitting (training/validation/test sets)
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Dealing with imbalanced datasets

### 2. Model Training (`2_Model_Training.ipynb`)
Understand model selection and training:
- Choosing appropriate models
- Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and Random Search
- Cross-validation techniques
- Model complexity considerations

### 3. Model Evaluation (`3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`)
Master model evaluation techniques:
- Classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Understanding overfitting and underfitting
- Benchmarking against existing models
- Performance visualization

### 4. Model Interpretability (`4_Model_Interpretability.ipynb`)
Explore model interpretability methods:
- White box vs. black box models
- Feature importance analysis
- SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values
- Practical interpretation techniques
